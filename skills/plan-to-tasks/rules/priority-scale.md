# Priority Scale

- **P0 (0)**: Architectural decisions, core abstractions (HITL required)
- **P1 (1)**: Integration points between modules (integrate early)
- **P2 (2)**: Unknown unknowns, spike work (risky work first)
- **P3 (3)**: Standard features, implementation
- **P4 (4)**: Polish, clean-up, quick wins

Rationale: Hard tasks first. Easy work can bury you in tech debt. Fail fast on risky work.
